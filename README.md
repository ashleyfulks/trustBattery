### Problem

When selecting another entity to interact with, evaluating the level of trustworthiness with that entity is a difficult problem to solve. Some entities are very trustworthy and could be implicitly trusted to behave in a fair manner. Other times unscrupulous entities look for honest people to take advantage of. This software system will establish a "measurement" of an entities trust through the feedback of their interactions with others in the network. This software is essentially a tool to use, as well as your own discretion, to decide to interact with another entity and if you do, where to set your expectation levels.

### Who to trust?

This app aims to solve the age old problem of who to trust. For example there are 10 carpenters in town and you need a deck built, who are you going to hire? The cheapest? The one with the most reviews? The highest rated one on Google? The one your friend knows is really good and fair? So many times people have become serial victims of "fly by night" entities whose aim is to take advantage of trusting people. This system will make it obvious who is the most trustworthy and fair business as the carpenters will be sorted according to trust level through their interactions with others, written in the immutable blockchain.

### Entities

An entity may be:

- An adult person (over 18 years old verified by social media account or email)
- A juvenile (under 18 years old and has special rules)
- A business (linked to website or person)
- An organization such as charity (linked to website or person)
- An institution such as government or political group (linked to person or website)

### Nash Equilibrium

Game theorists use the Nash equilibrium concept to analyze the outcome of the strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome for each of them depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium

The system gamifies business interactions and trys to establish harmony to all entities in the interaction.

### The Contract Process

Each interaction between entities starts with a contract being written. For example, I need a deck built at my house, so I start a contract with the the following list of items.

- Must build a deck attached to my house in my back yard in Kelowna
- Quote must include materials and labor with no hidden costs
- Builder must be proficient at building decks and present pictures of decks they built
- Deck must be built from Cedar and stained a blue color (color #3D405B)
- Deck should take no more than 2 weeks to build from start to finish
- Builder must start within 30 days of accepting the contract
- Budget is from $2,500 - $5,000 for parts and labor

This request for service/labor is searchable for all other members (and potential members?)
Another entity on the network is searching for carpantry jobs and comes across the contract.
They read it, accept the terms but also suggest some changes such as:

- Builder will start in 45 days of accepting the contract
- Must view grounds prior to giving an exact dollar quote
- Costs do not include removing any old deck
- Existing work area must be clean of debris and approved by the builder before starting the job

The other party now has the option of accepting the new terms or requesting modifications.



### Cryptocurrency integration

The definition of Karma means "action, work or deed". Tokens in the Trust Battery eco system are called "Karma". Karma can be used in the following ways:

- To pay for goods or services in the ecosystem
- To reward others by tipping them
- To convert into other crypto currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum
- To sell for cash in local currency

There are many ways to make Karma in the system. Here is a list:

- Joining the network
- Assisting to add other people to the system (on-boarding)
- Engaging others in interactions in the ecosystem
- Receiving payment for goods or services performed in Karma
- Providing services to the Arbitration ecosystem (Peer Jury for example)

### The ideal interaction

The general idea is two entities with high trust batteries can interact with each other having a high probability of trust level between them immediately. Both parties know that violating trust can mean negative consequences to their own Trust Batteries and in turn reduce their Trust Battery levels. A positive interaction with others in the network means a boost to the entities trust rating. The exact rules to how this works needs to be flushed out.

The idea is honest and fair entities will eventually float to the top. They will establish a high trust rating (100%) and have very low issues. They will also amass Karma which they can use inside the ecosystem. One of the main advantages to the network is those entities can now have a trusted pool of suppliers, businesses and individuals in the network that they can do business with a level of high integrity.

### That person has issues

As well the system tracks metrics like "issues" and can be used to arbitrate two parties in conflict to come to a fair resolution. The best outcome to a conflict is a sense of harmony afterwards with no issues. This system will be programmed in such a way to try to attain harmony in all interactions. If harmony cannot be achieved then a fair compromise can be sought. In the event a fair compromise is not possible, and negotiations have failed then one of the parties who is judged by their peers (3 chosen randomly) will have an "issue" attached to their permanent record in the blockchain and the matter will be considered closed. There is a window for appeal 3 times and the third time the judgement is made, the decision sticks. The number of "issues" entities have will be displayed publicly for all others to see before interacting with that entity. This could hurt their ability to connect with others in the network in the future. There is an optional system for "amends" where entities who have an issue decide to reach out to the other party and "make it right". If the other party and Peer Jury decide that the other party "made them whole" then the issue could be removed from their record, but of course the history of that issue would still remain because blockchain history is immutable.

### Scope on Entities

Any entity can join the network. If it is a company, that company can be connected to individuals that work in the company, however there are situations where honest people can work for a dishonest company and have no power over that.

### Issues

Other than Trust Battery level, issues are tracked. Anytime an entity in the system feels their trust has been violated, they can create an issue with another entity. At that time 3 judges are randomly selected from the network and offered tokens as payment to deal with the issue. Evidence is entered and anonomized and presented to the judges. The judges then make a decision that trust has or has not been violated. The decision the judges make influence

3 strikes you out - 3 choices to appeal a decision - 2 out of three (final decisions) stick. So if the appeal shows trust is broken the first time, there is an appeal and another decision that trust is broken, means there will be no third appeal as 2/3 appeals have made a final decision.
Negotiations to "make it right" and avoid a decision - negotiations recorded

### Rewards

The network and processes are setup in such a way that there are positive and negative feedback. Positive interactions with other entities in the system bring rewards such as

- higher Trust Battery score
- higher interaction levels
- Crypto currency rewards

### Arbitration

The shining goal of the arbitration system is to establish Harmony, which is "agreement or concord". The process flow should always be trying to make the most fair end result

### Searching the Network

### Examples/Story



### Integrity of the Network

Integrity of the network cannot be understated. Entities looking to use the system will evaluate the whole trust system and it must be found to be pure and uncorruptable. There are some systems that make sense in order for this to happen.

1) A non-for profit organization runs the Trust Battery day to day. They must have a clear mandate and operate with the best interests of the network in mind. Obviously they must be trustworthy and have a high trust battery level.

2) Open source. Anyone can read the rules and contribute to making code changes, similar to how bitcoin grew.

3) The network system must never do any action that violates other entities trust. This includes personal information collected
